This project demonstrates the use of the NE555 integrated circuit to generate flashing signals for an LED and count the resulting periods. The NE555 is a versatile timer chip that can be configured in a variety of ways, and is commonly used in electronics projects for timing and signal generation.

In this project, we use the NE555 in astable mode to generate a continuous series of pulses that drive the LED on and off at a regular rate. By adjusting the values of the timing resistors and capacitors, we can control the frequency of the pulses and thus the rate of the flashing.

We also use the NE555 in monostable mode to count the period of the LED flashes. When the LED turns on, a trigger signal is sent to the NE555, which starts a timing cycle. When the LED turns off, another signal is sent, which stops the timing cycle and produces an output signal that indicates the duration of the flash.

The circuit is relatively simple and easy to build, making it a great project for students or hobbyists interested in learning more about electronics. The code and schematic diagrams are provided in this repository, along with instructions for building and testing the circuit.

We hope that this project inspires others to experiment with the NE555 and explore the many possibilities it offers for creative electronics projects.
